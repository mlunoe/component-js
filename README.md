component.js
===

A minimal modular application structure (boilerplate) in plain JavaScript (ES5) for creating reusable components. The application is a small Image Viewer used as an example for testing the abilities and limitations of the main [Component.js](https://github.com/mlunoe/component-js/blob/master/app/components/Component/Component.js) and structure.

See [Component.js](https://github.com/mlunoe/component-js/blob/master/app/components/Component/Component.js) and an example usage here: [SearchBar.js](https://github.com/mlunoe/component-js/blob/master/app/components/SearchBar/SearchBar.js).

### Usage

Built with node v4.4.4 and npm v3.9.1.
Tested on Chrome v50.0.2661,  Firefox v46.0.1, Safari v9.1.1 and IE11

```
npm install && npm start
open http://localhost:8080
```

See it running here [http://mlunoe.github.io/component-js](http://mlunoe.github.io/component-js)

```js
var Component = require('../Component/Component');
var ObjectUtil = require('./utils/ObjectUtil');

module.exports = function MyComponent() {
  // Private scope

  return ObjectUtil.inherits({
    componentDidMount(element) {
      // Do something with element after mount
    },

    componentWillUnmount() {
      // Clean up component
    },

    getView(parentElement) {
      // Return string of component view
      return (
        '<div>' +
          'Example DIV' +
        '</div>'
      );
    }
  }, Component);
};

// Mount component
var container = document.createElement('div');
new MyComponent().render(container);
```

### Focus:
- The focus of this application is on building out a modular application structure with self-contained components
- The main building blocks of the app is the [Component.js](https://github.com/mlunoe/component-js/blob/master/app/components/Component/Component.js), [EventEmitter.js](https://github.com/mlunoe/component-js/blob/master/app/events/EventEmitter.js) and [ObjectUtil.js](https://github.com/mlunoe/component-js/blob/master/app/utils/ObjectUtil.js).

### Limitations
- This application is built using only ES5, without Babel polyfill or any JavaScript framework or libraries
- There is still some polish left to do there for it to be super appealing visually
- Only a few essential parts of the app have supporting unit tests, like the Component, EventEmitter and ObjectUtil, but a lot of the visual parts needs tests
- Using JSONP, which is a hacky way of working around cross origin issues (it also has the problem of not being cancellable). This app should really have its own server to request content from
- Missing to handle loading and errors for the image viewer, and thumbnail grid
- If screen gets too wide compared to width (image ratio is 9/16), the image gets cut off at the bottom
- Image that does not follow the 9/16 ratio gets cut off to fit the ratio, in order to make the elements look nice
- IE overflows the grid, because of scrollbar

### Features
- The page displays images from the Flickr feed
- Typing something in the search bar will display images from that search
- Clicking an image opens the image viewer modal
- When the modal is open you can click the arrows at the bottom to navigate back and forth, or use the left and right arrow keys
- When the modal is open you can click close button (Ã—) to close the modal, or use the esc key
